## Notes on JGraphT and JGraphX: (My understanding of the library)

The official documentation for jGraph is at [here](https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/docs/manual_javavis.html#1.6.1)

JGraphX is version 6 of JGraph. Think of it as JGraph 6. So, JGraphX v1 = JGraph v6.
JGraphX is actually the Java flavor of mxGraph, it is licensed under the BSD clause.
Main package is `com.mxgraph.*` and main class is `mxGraph`

### Layouts in JGraphX: 
JGraphX supports tree, force-directed and hierarchical layouts.
